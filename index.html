									<h2>Nicole Starosielski</h2>
									<p>Nicole Starosielski’s research focuses on the global distribution of digital media, and the relationship between technology, society, and the aquatic environment. Her book, <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/The-Undersea-Network"><em>The Undersea Network</em></a>, examines the cultural and environmental dimensions of transoceanic cable systems, beginning with the telegraph cables that formed the first global communications network and extending to the fiber-optic infrastructure that carries almost international Internet traffic. Starosielski has published essays on how Fiji’s video stores serve as a nexus of digital media access (<em>Media Fields Journal</em>), on Guam’s critical role in transpacific digital exchange (<em>Amerasia</em>), on the cultural imbrications of cable systems in Hawaii and California (<em>Journal of Visual Culture</em>), and photo essays on undersea cables (<em>Octopus and Media-N</em>). Before coming to NYU, she taught at Miami University of Ohio. She received her Ph.D. from UC-Santa Barbara.</p>

							<h3>"Digital Heat and the Infrared Image" — Nicole Starosielski</h3>
							<p>All matter emits heat and is transformed by it. In thermal vision, such heat exchanges are transduced into visual images. And in turn, infrared images, entangled with infrastructures of temperature control, modulate our movements through the world. This talk focuses on the ways that regimes of thermal perception and control are changing with digital technologies and the popularization of thermal imaging.</p>
							<h3>"Making Sense at the End of Time" — Casey Boyle</h3>
							<p>From carcinogens at the molecular level to climate collapse at a global scale, the space of “everyday” life is now beset--every day--by extraordinary calamities. Given the onslaught of these multiple and unending disasters, it is difficult to come to terms not only with resolutions to these many problems but also to develop a sense of the problems themselves. In short, we fail, repeatedly, to make sense. What senses might we develop, which sense-abilities might we cultivate by repeatedly engaging multiple senses in ways that are not intended to represent but to make sense? In response to these questions, this presentation will make a methodological intervention into our ways of making sense by surveying recent developments of empirical research methods and proposing a renewal of rhetorical methods with and through digital media technologies.</p>
